The adventure begins with a merchant convoy far out at sea. After a terrible storm, you wash up on the shores of a mysterious landmass â€“ a vast island where no island is supposed to be. The party will be tasked with exploring a land ravaged by a terrible curse, discovering its secrets, and eventually facing the grim root of the problem.
