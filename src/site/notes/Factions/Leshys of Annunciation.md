A small grove is here, trees growing on the greater tree. The grove somehow flourishes with a variety of fruit trees, and a handful of shy wood wisps drift about their branches. This grove is also home to a band of leshys that have dwelt on and in the divine tree of Annunciation for as long as any of them can remember. Their leader is [[Character Index/Leshy Village/Fjederes\|Fjederes]], a sunflower leshy. Though cheerful and trusting by nature, recent events have forced her to be more cautious and careful, and she takes her responsibility of keeping the grove and its leshys safe very seriously.
