Burmecia, Realm of Eternal Rain is a city-state in the northwestern part of the Mist Continent on Gaia. Burmecia is a walled, multi-leveled, warren-like city built around the royal palace and showered by constant rain. In comparison to Lindblum's industrial revolution style and [[Factions/Alexandria\|Alexandria]]'s high medieval style, Burmecia has a design style reminiscent of Antoni Gaud√≠'s organic mosaic buildings.

Burmecia is the only nation on the Mist Continent that lies below the Mist, though the constant rain that falls over the area there may dissipate some of the mists harmful aspects. The Burmecians army is the Dragon Knights.

It is unclear when the kingdom of Burmecia was formed, but it is sometime before the summoner tribe left [[Factions/Alexandria\|Alexandria]], as the Desert Star was given to the kingdom for safekeeping around year 1300. The question of the ownership of the Desert Star triggered a civil war between thirty and forty years ago. The late king of Alexandria perished in this war.
