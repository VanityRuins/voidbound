![Alexandria.jpg](/img/user/Assets/Alexandria.jpg)
Alexandria is both a kingdom and the capital of that kingdom, and for a time the capital of the Alexandrian Empire, on the planet of Gaia. The city is centered on a plateau in the northern Mist Continent, extending out over the Zamo and Gunitas basins.

A monarchy, it is ruled by Queen Brahne Raza Alexandros XVI with Princess Garnet Til Alexandros XVII as its heir. Alexandria is known for its exclusively female lead army led by General Beatrix with most male knights only tasked with protecting the city or manning the navy. These are known as the Knights of Pluto.

This is the homeland of the colony [[Factions/Avalon\|Avalon]]
