Nestled at the edge of a sandy coastline, the fledgling settlement from [[Factions/Alexandria\|Alexandria]] clings to the boundary between land and sea, where the last dunes give way to firm, grassy fields. Makeshift shelters and half-built structures form a scattered crescent along the shore, their timbers salvaged from the broken bones of the convoy wreckage that still litters the beach in either direction—splintered hulls, tattered sails, and rusted fittings glinting in the salt-washed sun.

Behind the settlement, the ground quickly rises into a broad, green sward of windblown grasses, where the earth is firm enough to build and plant. But even this oasis of stability feels like borrowed time, for just beyond the rise, the land dips again into a shadowy tangle of mangrove marsh. There, twisted roots rise like grasping fingers from the brackish water, and narrow waterways wind through dense thickets, vanishing into the gloom. The air is thick with the scent of salt, rot, and life.

This is a place of beginnings. A tenuous foothold carved from the wreckage of failure, staring out across the ruins of the past and the dangers of the wild. Here, you will help shape what comes next—whether the settlement becomes a beacon of resilience, or is reclaimed by tide, rot, and creeping shadow.
