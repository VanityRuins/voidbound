# Crash landing

A terrible storm began to brew as we approached the island, Kupo! The captain seemed nonchalant but everyone else began to scramble about, I know I did.

Once we woke up on the damned soggy beach, the poor want to be colonists were set upon by a bunch of coconuts, rocks, water and even living little balls of fire! We dispatched them, well; they did I mostly tossed a pot or two and called it good, Kupo!

Now that we have gathered the bits and bobbles that made it out of the wreck rather unscathed, we sat up our rudimentary encampment and we were tasked with mapping out the island.

We being Moss, myself of course, Lyam with the Wolf he calls moodlight, moonwhite, something like that. Cat boy Kirito who rather likes to settle things with his fists; a massive Minotaur name Keranos, who was the sole reason that we had a set number of rations on the boat. They had to be able to feed that behemoth; and then there is Hellena who seems aloof if a bit dangerous, I bet my whiskers she knows where to make money, Kupo! Though on this island with no easy marks, no commerce and no trade, the options for a cash settlement are a little rough.

We ended up moving in from a big fallen log that seems to have housed an entire little maze with some rather nice furniture. For now, we move forward.

Until I came upon horrific beings with lumpy terrible randomly shaped bodies! They attack us, and without too much ado we manage to remove these immaterial beings, who then seemingly dissolved, which was beautiful and weird much like this Island.
