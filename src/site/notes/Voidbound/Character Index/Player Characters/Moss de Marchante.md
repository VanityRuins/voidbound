# Ancestry: Moogle ((Moogle ))
-
; Humanoid, Moogle, Moogle
Moogles are mysterious creatures often found throughout the Shards. Their bodies are strange, fluffy mixtures of moles and bats, and while their appearance differs from Shard to Shard, they are almost all identifiable by the batlike wings on their backs and the brightly colored poms on their heads. 
# You Might…
- Add “kupo” to the end of your sentences

- Resent the fact that people constantly say “kupo” to you.

- Be anxious around water and the idea of getting wet

# Others Probably…
- Consider you and your people a myth, depending on the Shard

- Wonder what your pom is made of

- Theorize on how you are able to fly, given your large and fluffy body

# Physical Description
Moogles are small creatures, typically averaging only 2 or 3 fulms tall. Their bodies are covered in thick white fur, save for small purple bat wings that protrude from their back. Each Moogle also has a pom; a softly glowing ball in a variety of colors which sticks out on a small antenna from the Moogle’s head. 
# Society
Moogle society tends to vary from Shard to Shard. On some Shards, Moogles live in small, close-knit communities sheltered away from the outside world. On other Shards, Moogles are cosmopolitan creatures, congregating in large cities and settlements in search of new stories to tell, new people to meet, and new adventures to behold.

**Low-light Vision**
You can see in dim light as though it were bright light, so you ignore the concealed condition due to dim light.

**Wings**
When Leaping horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet. You don't automatically fail your checks to High Jump or Long Jump if you don't Stride at least 10 feet first. In addition, when you make a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet further than your Athletics check result, though still with the normal maximum of your Speed.
# **Names**
Moogle naming conventions heavily favor certain words and sounds, often drawn from Moogle vocabulary and mixed with Hyur-sounding names. “Mog” is an extremely popular sound in Moogle names, while some prefer “ku” or “po” sounds. Male Moogles tend more towards “ku” sounds, while female Moogles tend towards “po” sounds. Of course, there are sometimes wild variants, as more well-traveled Moogles might take on names completely divorced from their traditional name schemes.

# Charlatan ((Charlatan ))
## background

**Source** Pathfinder Player Core

You traveled from place to place, peddling false fortunes and snake oil in one town, pretending to be royalty in exile to seduce a wealthy heir in the next. Becoming an adventurer might be your next big scam or an attempt to put your talents to use for a greater cause. Perhaps it's a bit of both, as you realize that after pretending to be a hero, you've become the mask.

Choose two attribute boosts. One must be to **Intelligence** or **Charisma**, and one is a free attribute boost.

You're trained in the Deception skill and the Underworld Lore skill. You gain the *Charming Liar* skill feat.



  


# Class: Alchemist ((Alchemist ))
*There's no sight more beautiful to you than a strange brew bubbling in a beaker, and you consume your ingenious elixirs with abandon. You're fascinated by uncovering the secrets of science and the natural world, and you're constantly experimenting in your lab or on the go with inventive concoctions for every eventuality. You are fearless in the face of risk, hurling explosive or toxic creations at your foes. Your unique path toward greatness is lined with alchemical brews that push your mind and body to their limits.*

; Alchemist
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

During your daily preparations, you spend some time to create alchemical items that can be used over the course of the day.

You don't need to attempt a Crafting check to do this, you can use an alchemist's toolkit instead of an alchemist's lab, and you ignore both the number of days typically required to create the items and any alchemical raw materials requirements.

You can Craft a number of alchemical items up to 4 + your Intelligence modifier. Each item must be in your formula book, have an item level equal to or lower than your level, and have the consumable trait.

These items have the infused trait and remain potent for 24 hours or until your next daily preparations, whichever comes first.



  


# Alchemy ((++Alchemy ))

; Alchemist
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

You understand the reactions between all manner of reagents and can concoct alchemical items to meet your needs. You can do this using normal reagents and the Craft activity, or you can use specially prepared chemicals that allow you to craft temporary items quickly and at no cost. Over time, you can create more and more alchemical items for free, and since each of them becomes more and more powerful, you advance in power dramatically, leaving behind those who don't understand your strange science.

You gain the *Alchemical Crafting* feat, and you can automatically identify alchemical items that you have the formula for.



  


# Chirurgeon ((++Chirurgeon ))
##  1
-
; Alchemist
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

You concentrate on healing others with alchemy.

**Formulas** Two common 1st-level alchemical elixirs with the healing trait (like @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.ktjFOp3U0wQD9t0Z]{lesser antidote}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.UqinuuCWePTYGhVO]{lesser antiplague}, or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.hDLbR56Id2OtU318]{minor elixir of life}).

**Field Benefit** You can use your proficiency rank in Crafting for anything that requires a proficiency rank in Medicine (such as prerequisites) and use your Crafting modifier in place of your Medicine modifier for all Medicine checks.

**Field Vials** Your versatile vials can be used to heal a living creature a number of Hit Points equal to the vial's initial damage. A creature can drink the vial for this benefit, or you can throw the vial at a willing creature within 20 feet as an Interact action to heal that creature. In either case, a vial used this way loses the acid and splash traits and gains the coagulant and healing traits, plus the elixir trait if a creature drinks it.

***Field Discovery* (5th)** Your medicinal elixirs are quite fortifying. When a creature drinks an infused elixir with the healing trait that you have created, that creature gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 0); these temporary Hit Points last for 1 minute.

***Advanced Vials* (11th)** When you use a field vial to heal a creature that has half its maximum Hit Points or fewer, the coagulant trait doesn't apply to that healing.

***Greater Field Discovery* (13th)** When you use Quick Alchemy to create any type of elixir of life, the creature healed by the item regains the maximum Hit Points possible, instead of rolling to determine the number of Hit Points regained.



  


# Formula Book ((++Formula Book ))
##  1
-
; Alchemist
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

An alchemist keeps meticulous formulas for every item they can create. You start with a standard @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.qCEOZ6109Yo34tRx]{Formula Book} for free. The formula book contains the formulas for two common 1st-level alchemical items of your choice, in addition to any formulas you gained from *Alchemical Crafting* and your research field.

Each time you gain a level, you can add the formulas for two common alchemical items to your formula book. These new formulas can be for any level of item you can create. You learn these formulas automatically, but it's also possible to find or buy additional formulas in settlements or from other alchemists, or to select the *Inventor* skill feat so you can invent them.

As normal, having the base formula is sufficient when Crafting upgraded types of the item—you don't need to learn higher-level formulas. For instance, if you have the 1st-level formula for a minor elixir of life, you can create a minor, lesser, moderate, greater, major, or true elixir of life as long as you meet the level and other prerequisites. Items with type entries that have widely varied functions require separate formulas, but most alchemical items have a structure similar to elixir of life.

Your inquiries into the alchemical nature of the universe have led you to focus on a particular field of research. At 1st level, you choose your research field. This choice gives you more formulas, a special benefit, other abilities for your versatile vials, and other benefits as you level up.



  


# Versatile Vials ((++Versatile Vials ))

; Alchemist
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

You know how to prepare fast-acting chemicals into versatile vials, special items that can be used as bombs and be turned into other alchemical items by introducing special reagents. During your daily preparations, you can create a number of versatile vials up to 2 + your Intelligence modifier, which is also your maximum number of vials. If you're below your maximum number, you can gather reagents from the environment around you. For every 10 minutes you spend in exploration mode, you regain 2 vials; this doesn't prevent you from participating in other exploration activities.

Versatile vials are infused items, and are destroyed if not used by the next time you make your daily preparations. A vial you create is always the highest type you could Craft. See the sidebar for statistics on using a versatile vial as a bomb. You can also use vials for *Quick Alchemy* and your research field can add to the ways you can use a vial.

You can store all your versatile vials within your @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.equipment-srd.Item.4ftXXUCBHcf4b0MH]{Alchemist's Toolkit}, with no increase to its Bulk. Though versatile vials are physical objects, they can't be duplicated or preserved in any way.

You have used alchemy to create life, a simple creature formed from alchemical materials, reagents, and a bit of your own blood. You gain a familiar, which has the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.5eqcXtPsYunphMOZ]{Construct} familiar ability; this is permanent, doesn't require the familiar to have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.familiar-abilities.Item.Le8UWr5BU8rV3iBf]{Tough} familiar ability, and doesn't count against your usual limit of familiar abilities (typically 2). The familiar uses your Intelligence modifier to determine its Perception, Acrobatics, and Stealth modifiers.



  


# Charming Liar ((+Charming Liar ))
## feat 1

; General, Skill

**Prerequisites** trained in Deception
-
Your charm allows you to win over those you lie to. When you get a critical success using the *Lie* action, the target's attitude toward you improves by one step, as though you'd succeeded at using Diplomacy to *Make an Impression*. This works only once per conversation, and if you critically succeed against multiple targets using the same result, you choose one creature's attitude to improve. You must be lying to impart seemingly important information, inflate your status, or ingratiate yourself, which trivial or irrelevant lies can't achieve.

## cantrip 1
-
; Auditory, Cantrip, Concentrate, Illusion, Manipulate
**Source** Pathfinder Core Rulebook

**Tradition** arcane, occult

**Range** 30 feet

-
You create an auditory illusion of simple sounds that has a maximum volume equal to four normal humans shouting. The sounds emanate from a square you designate within range. You can't create intelligible words or other intricate sounds (such as music).

-
**Heightened (3rd)** The range increases to 60 feet.

## cantrip 1
-
; Cantrip, Concentrate, Light, Manipulate

-
You create an orb of light that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius (and dim light for the next 20 feet) in a color you choose. If you create the light in the same space as a willing creature, you can attach the light to the creature, causing it to float near that creature as it moves. You can Sustain the spell to move the light up to 60 feet; you can attach or detach it from a creature as part of this movement.

You can Dismiss the spell. If you Cast the Spell while you already have four *light* spells active, you must choose one of the existing spells to end.

*Spell Effect: Light*

-
**Heightened (4th)** The orb sheds light in a 60-foot radius (and dim light for the next 60 feet).



  


# Prestidigitation :aa: ((+Prestidigitation ))
## cantrip 1
-
; Cantrip, Concentrate, Manipulate
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core

**Tradition** arcane, divine, occult, primal

**Range** 10 feet; **Targets** 1 object (cook, lift, or tidy only)

-
The simplest magic does your bidding. You can perform simple magical effects for as long as you Sustain the spell. Each time you Sustain the spell, you can choose one of four options.
- **Cook** Cool, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material.
- **Lift** Slowly lift an unattended object of light Bulk or less 1 foot off the ground.
- **Make** Create a temporary object of negligible Bulk, made of congealed magical substance. The object looks crude and artificial and is extremely fragile-it can't be used as a tool, weapon, or locus or cost for a spell.
- **Tidy** Color, clean, or soil an object of light Bulk or less. You can affect an object of 1 Bulk with 10 rounds of concentration, and a larger object at 1 minute per Bulk.
*Prestidigitation* can't deal damage or cause adverse conditions. Any actual change to an object (beyond what is noted above) persists only as long as you Sustain the spell.
