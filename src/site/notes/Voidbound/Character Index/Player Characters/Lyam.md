# Ancestry: Elezen ((Elezen ))
-
; Elezen, Elezen
Known throughout the realms by many names, including Elves and Elvaan, Elezen are a long-lived people known for their impressive and ancient civilizations; tall, slender builds; and their ancient pride.
# You Might…
- See the honor of your house and family as your highest priority

- Be callous towards those of less “prestigious” civilizations (read: everyone who isn’t an elezen)

- Have dabbled in several different hobbies and passions over the years

# Others Probably…
- See you as aloof and uncaring at times

- Wonder how old you actually are, unable to tell by looking

- Think you know at least a little about every subject

# Physical Description
Elezen are tall and slender of build, often reaching heights of over six fulms. Of particular note is the Elezen’s long neck, which adds a few inches to their height on average. In addition, they are known to possess long, slender ears much more sensitive to sound than the average Hyur. 
# Society
Regardless of the world they inhabit, Elezen tend to congregate in ancient cities and amass powerful civilizations. They often lay claim to the oldest civilizations in a given region, and as a result are often the most entrenched in their ways. Elezen civilizations often have trouble pivoting as new ideas spread and flourish.
# Names
Elezen names most resemble our French names, with certain particular naming conventions. Female names tend towards ending in “e”, “ette”, or “elle”; and are typically shorter than their male equivalents. Male names, meanwhile, tend to end in “x” (or a combination ending in “x”, just as “aux” or “loix”) or to end in a silent “t”, such as “mont”. 

**Sample Names**
**Ameline, Alisaie, Darseloix, Florentel, Jolaine, Prishe, Gaspard**

<div><div><div><div>You once freed a magical beast from captivity and, whether it was intentional or a byproduct of another action, the grateful creature bestowed a blessing of freedom upon you.

# Class: Champion ((Champion ))
*You are an emissary of a deity, a devoted servant who has taken up a weighty mantle, and you adhere to a code that holds you apart from those around you. While champions exist for every alignment, as a champion of good, you provide certainty and hope to the innocent. You have powerful defenses that you share freely with your allies and innocent bystanders, as well as holy power you use to end the threat of evil. Your devotion even attracts the attention of holy spirits who aid you on your journey.*

You devote yourself to a specific cause in your deity's name. Some are limited to sanctification, as noted in parentheses. Your cause adds to your edicts and anathema and grants you a special reaction called your champion's reaction, which appears after the divider, along with its upgrades if you gain the relentless reaction and exalted reaction class features at higher levels.

***Desecration* (Unholy):** You selfishly corrupt and destroy.

***Grandeur* (Holy):** You exemplify the glory and splendor of the celestial realms.

***Iniquity* (Unholy):** You destroy, take advantage, and act with dishonor.

***Justice*:** You follow laws and mete out just punishment.

***Liberation*:** You oppose tyranny and fight for freedom.

***Obedience*:** You enforce hierarchies and order.

***Redemption* (Holy):** You try to redeem those who commit wicked deeds.

**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

You're surrounded by an aura in a 15-foot emanation. It has the aura and divine traits. Any follower of your deity within the aura immediately knows you're a champion of your deity. This aura is used as the range for your champion's reaction and for various other effects. You can suppress or resume the aura as a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and it ends if you fall *Unconscious*.

You zealously bear your deity's favored weapon. If it's an unarmed attack with a d4 damage die or a simple weapon, increase the damage die by one step (d4 to d6, d6 to d8, d8 to d10, d10 to d12). If the weapon is uncommon, you gain access to it, and if it's an advanced weapon, you treat it as a martial weapon for the purposes of proficiency

item(
# Deity (Champion) ((++Deity (Champion) ))
##  1
-
; Champion
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

As a champion, you are a warrior in the name of a deity you revere above all others. Choose one deity.
# Skill
You become trained in the divine skill listed for your deity. As normal, if you're already trained in that skill, you become trained in a different skill of your choice.
# Anathema
Champions care deeply about the edicts and anathema they take from their deity, sanctification, and cause. As with any implementation of edicts and anathema in the rules, these are a tool for roleplaying between you, the GM, and the other players at the table—you're still playing a nuanced character, not strictly following a script.

Acts fundamentally opposed to your deity's ideals are anathema to your faith. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are anathema to your deity remove you from your deity's good graces.

Similarly, using items, spells, or actions that are anathema to the tenets or goals of your faith could interfere with your connection to your deity. For example, assisting with a ritual that raises undead would be anathema to Pharasma, the goddess of death. Many actions that are anathema don't appear in any deity's formal list. For borderline cases, you and your GM determine which acts are anathema.

If you perform enough acts that are anathema to your deity, you lose the magical abilities that come from your connection to your deity. The class features that you lose are determined by the GM, but they likely include your holy or unholy trait, your focus pool, and your blessing of the devoted. These abilities can be regained only if you repent by conducting an atone ritual. If your deity doesn't require the specific sanctification you had, your GM might let you retrain your sanctification and cause while still following the same deity.
# Sanctification
Depending on your deity, their sanctification can make you holy or unholy. This commits you to one side of a struggle over souls. Whether you become holy, unholy, or neither will limit your choice of causes, devotion spells, and feats.

If you "can be" holy or unholy according to your deity's sanctification entry, you make that choice, and if you "must be" holy or unholy, you gain the trait automatically. If the deity lists "none," you can choose only options that don't require the holy or unholy trait. If you are holy or unholy and gain the opposing trait in some way, you lose the previous trait until you atone.

Unholy sanctification for a champion can be extremely disruptive to a typical game and should be a player character option only in appropriate adventures or campaigns where the group collectively decides to embrace them. Unholy sanctification and causes are uncommon options.

**Holy:** You gain the holy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, "Do not knowingly harm innocents or fail to prevent harm to an innocent if your direct intervention could save them" and the anathema "Commit murder." Even if your game includes behavior outside the Pathfinder baseline, the acts listed there are anathema to you.

**Unholy:** You gain the unholy trait and add that trait to any Strikes you make. You gain the edict, "Do not put another's needs before your own or those of your deity" and the anathema "Commit an entirely altruistic act, such as giving something away in charity" and "Put anyone's needs before those of your deity." None of these prevents you from performing acts others might consider helpful, but these acts must be done with the expectation that they ultimately further your own goals or those of your deity

# Devotion Spells ((++Devotion Spells ))
##  1
-
; Champion
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

Your deity's power grants you special divine spells called devotion spells, which are a type of focus spell. Choose either *Shields of the Spirit* or a spell based on your deity's divine font (*Lay on Hands* if your deity allows *heal*, *Touch of the Void* if your deity allows *harm*).

It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell. When you gain your first devotion spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to pray to your deity or do service toward their causes.

Your devotion spells are divine spells. Your spellcasting attribute is Charisma.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Certain feats give you more focus spells. The maximum Focus Points your focus pool can hold is equal to the number of focus spells you have, but can never be more than 3 points.

**Anathema** force or threaten someone to act a certain way, engage in slavery or tyranny
-**Champion's Reaction** *Liberating Step*

**Relentless Reaction (9th Level)** You punish those who ensnare your allies. If the triggering enemy was using any effects to make your ally *Grabbed*, *Restrained*, *Immobilized*, or *Paralyzed* when you used Liberating Step, that enemy takes persistent spirit damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

**Exalted Reaction (11th Level)** In addition to the ally affected by Liberating Step, you and all other allies in your champion's aura can Step as a free action. You and your allies gain the benefit even if the ally who benefited from Liberating Step can't move.

# Beastmaster Dedication ((+Beastmaster Dedication ))
## feat 2

; Archetype, Dedication
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core 2

**Prerequisites** trained in Nature
-
You gain the service of a young animal companion that travels with you and obeys your commands. Contrary to the usual rules for animal companions, this feat can grant you a second animal companion. If you ever have more than one animal companion, you gain the Call Companion action. See the Beastmaster Animal Companions sidebar for details on this action.

Certain beastmaster feats give you focus spells. When you gain your first beastmaster focus spell, you become trained in the spell attack modifier and spell DC statistics. Your key spellcasting attribute for beastmaster archetype spells is Charisma, and they are primal spells. You can Refocus by feeding, playing with, or otherwise tending to an animal companion.
-**BEASTMASTER ANIMAL COMPANIONS**

If you're playing a beastmaster, you determine the statistics and abilities of your animal companions. As a beastmaster, it's possible for you to have more than one animal companion at one time—up to four companions—but only one of those companions, your "active companion," follows you during exploration and in encounters; the rest are nearby, usually foraging or hunting for food. As soon as you gain a second animal companion from the Beastmaster archetype, you also gain *Call Companion* to switch your active companion. These rules apply to all your companions, regardless of whether you got the animal companion from the beastmaster archetype or from another source.
