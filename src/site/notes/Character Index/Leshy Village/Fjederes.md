Faction: [[Factions/Leshys of Annunciation\|Leshys of Annunciation]]
A circle of petals radiates from a sunflower [[Factions/Leshys of Annunciation\|Leshys of Annunciation]]â€™s head, ranging in color from soft butter yellow to bright orange to plum with white tips. Serrated green leaves sprout like a ruff beneath its head. A sunflower [[Factions/Leshys of Annunciation\|Leshys of Annunciation]] stands 4 feet tall and weighs 75 pounds.

Among the most social of leshys, sunflower leshys serve as the ambassadors and diplomats of leshykind.
