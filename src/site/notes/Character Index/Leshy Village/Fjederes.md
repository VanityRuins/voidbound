# Fjederes
![fjederes.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/fjederes.Token.webp)

A circle of petals radiates from a sunflower leshyâ€™s head, ranging in color from soft butter yellow to bright orange to plum with white tips. Serrated green leaves sprout like a ruff beneath its head. A sunflower leshy stands 4 feet tall and weighs 75 pounds.

Among the most social of leshys, sunflower leshys serve as the ambassadors and diplomats of leshykind.
