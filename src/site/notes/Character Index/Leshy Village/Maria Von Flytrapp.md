# Maria Von Flytrapp

Most leshys are peaceful creatures that focus their efforts on tending the natural region around them. While flytrap leshys do not leave their homes to pick fights, they relish the opportunity to attack intruders. While they rarely work together with other creatures, the aggressive creatures eagerly collaborate with others of their kind.  
  
Cantankerous flytrap leshys represent the harsh and seemingly cruel aspects of the natural cycle that are ultimately needed for the greater well-being of all creatures. When necessary to protect their homes, flytrap leshys start controlled fires, relying on their fire resistance to wade through the flames.

Unlike most of their kind, flytrap leshys eat flesh and are not picky about the kind of meat that they consume.

They particularly savor insects, and one of the few ways to placate a flytrap leshy is to offer it a rare or unusual insect to consume.
