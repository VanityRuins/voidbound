# Ancestry: Miqo'te ((Miqo'te ))
-
; Humanoid, Miqote, Miqote
The catlike Miqo’te have a long and storied history of being adventurers, hunters, and wanderers. Hailing from forest and jungle alike, these lithe and agile catfolk often find themselves employed as hunters, guides, and dancers.

- Take on jobs requiring skill, finesse, and agility

# Others Probably…

When you fall, you take only half the normal damage and don't land prone.

Physical Description
Miqo’te are distinguished by their feline features, particularly their catlike ears, eyes, and tails. Miqo’te are shorter than hyur on average, typically standing at about 5 fulms. Their bodies are, on the whole, lithe, although exceptions certainly exist. 

Among the Miqo’te heritages, Mithra in particular are more catlike than the rest, featuring more distinctly catlike faces and colorations.

While the discrepancy among sexes is not as wide as the Viera, Miqo’te men are known to be vanishingly rare. Of the rare few who chose to leave their enclaves, it is usually from the Keepers of the Moon.
# Society
Miqo’te society varies by heritage, but almost always revolves around the ancestry’s notable lack of men. In Seeker societies, tribes often form around single patriarchs known as Nunh. In Keeper and Mithra societies, the roles are reversed; matriarchies similar to Vieran society where the limited men rarely travel outside of their villages. 

Regardless of which society they come from, many Miqo’te build their societies around predation. Excelling in both hunting and fishing, Miqo’te civilizations rarely work the land but instead hunt from it. As such, they are adept at hunting in moderation and maintaining a healthy ecosystem.

**Names**
**Miqo’te names vary wildly from culture to culture. Seeker women typically take the surname of their tribe’s patriarch, while the men take either Nunh or Tia, depending on their level of status. All genders typically prefix their first names with a clan indicator consisting of the first letter of the clan followed by an apostrophe. This indicator is considered part of the Seeker’s name in polite company, although leaving it out is a sign of close friendship, love, or family.**
**
**
Keeper names tend to be less structured on the whole. Female Seekers often take on short names which their sons all inherit, each with a different suffix to indicate birth order. In order of first son, these suffixes are ‘a, ‘to, ‘li, ‘sae, ‘ra, ‘ir, ‘wo, ‘ya, ‘zi, and ‘tan. Thus, the fourth son of Okto Nima would be Okto’sae Nima.

# Class: Dominant ((Dominant ))
## Dominant (DMT)
Dominants are warriors born or otherwise merged with a powerful eikon. Seen by some as gods amongst men, they harness the power of the eikon to strengthen themselves and bring destruction to all who oppose them.

During Combat Encounters…
You channel your eikon through your body to prime yourself to perform powerful attacks and spells. Because priming yourself with your eikon's powers puts a strain on you, you must also learn to rely on your limited spells and infusions as well as your trusted weapon.


During Social Encounters…
Your natural charisma makes you good at interacting with people.


While Exploring…
Your flexibility means you might look for magical auras, remain on guard, or even sneak around. Your ability to fill different niches means that your role often depends on the talents of the other members of your group.


In Downtime…
You might attempt to learn more about the nature of your eidolon and delve deeper into the secrets of its magical tradition. 


You Might…
- Have a strong independent streak, and whether you embrace or reject your society's views on spellcasters, you see everyone as an individual and not as tools.

- View your eikonic link with fascination, fear, or something in between—anything from wholehearted acceptance to vehement rejection.

- Overreach with ambitious plans that pull you in too many directions at once.



Others Probably…
- Feel safe with you at their side.

- Expect that since you know information about your eikon, you might know details about other sorts of strange monsters.

- View you with awe or fear because of the powerful, strange power that accompanies you.

# Dominant Spellcasting ((++Dominant Spellcasting ))
##  1
-
; Dominant
**Your link to your eikon grants you limited magic connected to your eikons’s nature. You can cast spells using the Cast a Spell activity, and you can supply material, somatic, and verbal components when casting spells. Because of the magic you draw from your eikon, you can usually replace material components with somatic components, so you don’t need a material component pouch. You must know spells to cast them, and you learn them via the spell repertoire class feature. The number of spells you can cast each day is called your spell slots.**

As you increase in level as a dominant, the magical link with your eikon grants you additional, more powerful spell slots. Your total number of spell slots and the highest level of spells you can cast are shown in Table. Because of the way you draw magic from your connection to your eikon, you begin to lose lower-level spell slots once you reach 5th level. The maximum number of spell slots you get from the dominant class is four, starting when you reach 4th level.

Some of your spells require you to attempt a spell attack roll to see how effective they are, or have your enemies roll against your spell DC (typically by attempting a saving throw). Since your key ability is Charisma, your spell attack rolls and spell DCs use your Charisma modifier. Details on calculating these statistics appear in Spell Attack Roll.
**Heightening Spells**
When you gain spell slots of 2nd level and higher, you can fill those slots with stronger versions of lower-level spells. This increases the spell’s level, heightening it to match the spell slot. Many spells have specific improvements when they are heightened to certain levels.
**Cantrips**
A cantrip is a special type of spell that doesn’t use spell slots. You can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level rounded up—this is usually equal to the highest level of spell you can cast as a dominant. For example, as a 1st-level dominant, your cantrips are 1st-level spells, and as a 5th-level dominant, your cantrips are 3rd-level spells.

**You house a powerful entity known as your eikon within you, which you can call upon to heighten your power and ferocity. This is a practice known as priming.**

The dominant must choose one eikon to host.  A list of eikons can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gQYlhv5pfLn88N3pgfNGjMC38pbciBitbpav8dUgEZg/edit#heading=h.b4q0t13ym1f0" style="text-decoration:none">here</a>.

You can also summon forth the magic of your eikon. These are called Eikonic Infusions, special spells that have been forged through your shared connection with your eikon. Eikonic infusions are a type of focus spell. You learn the first of your eikon's infusions when you select your eikon. When you gain your first eikonic infusion spell, you also gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity.

Prerequisites Form a link with an eikon.
Requirements You aren’t fatigued or semi-priming.

You @UUID[Compendium.ff2e.items.Item.wiLAKMwNTFVAOLGH]{Semi-Prime} your body with the power of your eikon. You gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. While you are semi-primed:

- You gain a +1 status bonus on attack rolls and Will saves.

- You can't use actions with the concentrate trait, unless they also have the semi-prime trait. You can Seek while semi-priming.

- Your Strikes deal 1d6 additional points of damage based on your eikon’s damage type. If an eikon has multiple damage types (i.e. Phoenix), then you may choose which element to imbue the Strikes with.


Semi-prime lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until the encounter ends, whichever comes first. You can voluntarily stop semi-priming as a free action. When you stop semi-priming, you lose any remaining temporary Hit Points from Semi-prime, and can’t gain temporary Hit Points from using the Semi-prime action again for 1 minute.

# Spell Repertoire ((++Spell Repertoire ))
##  1
-
; Dominant
**The collection of spells you can cast is called your spell repertoire. At 1st level, you learn two 1st-level spells of your choice and four cantrips of your choice, as well as an additional spell and cantrip from your eikon. You choose these from the common spells from the tradition corresponding to your eikon, or from other spells from that tradition to which you have access. You can cast any spell in your spell repertoire by using a spell slot of an appropriate spell level. Your spell slots and the spells in your spell repertoire are separate. If a feat or other ability adds a spell to your spell repertoire, it doesn’t give you another spell slot, and vice versa.**

You add to this spell repertoire as you increase in level. Each time you get a spell slot, you add a spell of the same level to your spell repertoire. When you gain access to a new level of spells, a new spell is always granted by your eikon in addition to the one you add. At 2nd level, you select another 1st-level spell. At 3rd level, you add the first 2nd-level spell to your repertoire.
**Swapping Spells in Your Repertoire**
As you gain new spells in your repertoire, you might want to replace some of the spells you previously learned. Each time you gain a level and learn new spells, you can swap out one of your old spells for a different spell of the same level. If it’s a level at which you lose a set of lower-level slots, you can replace the two in either order. You can also instead swap a cantrip. You can also swap out spells by retraining during downtime.

At 6th level and every even level thereafter, you can swap out any number of your spells for different spells of a level you can cast. When you do, you must keep at least one spell you can cast with your lowest level of spell slots so you don’t end up with slots you can’t use. For instance, at 6th level you would need to keep at least one 2nd-level spell, but all your other spells could be 3rd level.

You draw water out of an object, possibly to clean up spills or quickly dry a soaked book or shirt. You draw up to a pint of water from the object; this dries objects of less than 1 Bulk. The water collects in a globule floating in your hand, which you can direct into a nearby container as part of Casting the Spell; otherwise, it splashes to the ground. Repeated applications of draw moisture can be used to dry larger objects, although doing so might take significant time. You can use this spell in especially humid environments to condense drinkable water from the air, though typically, you can't draw more than a few cups before depleting the ambient moisture.

You create an invisible anchor at a location within range (even if it's outside your line of sight or line of effect), as long as you can identify the location by its appearance (or other identifying features). You innately know the direction towards that location, including relative depth, but not the distance. Incorrect knowledge of the location's appearance usually causes the spell to fail, but it could instead lead to an unwanted location or some other unusual mishap determined by the GM. This spell doesn't help you find a suitable route to the location nor assist you in overcoming obstacles on the way there.

**Tradition** divine, occult

**Range** 30 feet; **Targets** 1 willing creature

**Duration** 10 minutes

-
You form a spiritual link with another creature, taking in its pain. When you Cast this Spell and at the start of each of your turns, if the target is below maximum Hit Points, it regains 2 Hit Points (or the difference between its current and maximum Hit Points, if that's lower). You lose as many Hit Points as the target regained.

This is a spiritual transfer, so no effects apply that would increase the Hit Points the target regains or decrease the Hit Points you lose. This transfer also ignores any temporary Hit Points you or the target have. Since this effect doesn't involve vitality or void energy, *spirit link* works even if you or the target is undead. While the duration persists, you gain no benefit from regeneration or fast healing. You can Dismiss this spell, and if you're ever at 0 Hit Points, *spirit link* ends automatically.
