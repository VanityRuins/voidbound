# Class: Rogue ((Rogue ))
*You are skilled and opportunistic. Using your sharp wits and quick reactions, you take advantage of your opponents' missteps and strike where it hurts most. You play a dangerous game, seeking thrills and testing your skills, and likely don't care much for any laws that happen to get in your way. While the path of every rogue is unique and riddled with danger, the one thing you all share in common is the breadth and depth of your skills.*

When your enemy can't properly defend itself, you take advantage to deal extra damage. If you Strike a creature that has the *Off-Guard* condition with an agile or finesse melee weapon, an agile or finesse unarmed attack, a ranged weapon attack, or a ranged unarmed attack, you deal an extra 1d6 precision damage. For a ranged attack with a thrown melee weapon, that weapon must also be agile or finesse.

As your level increases, so does the number of damage dice for your sneak attack. Increase the number of dice by one at 5th, 11th, and 17th levels.

**Source** Pathfinder Player Core

Nothing beats the thrill of taking something that belongs to someone else. You might be a pickpocket working the streets, a cat burglar sneaking through windows, or even a consultant, testing your clients' vaults for openings.

When a fight breaks out, you prefer swift, lightweight weapons, and you strike where it hurts. When you attack with a finesse melee weapon or finesse melee unarmed attack, you can add your Dexterity modifier to damage rolls instead of your Strength modifier.

You are trained in Thievery.

# Experienced Smuggler ((+Experienced Smuggler ))
## feat 1
-
; General, Skill
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core

**Prerequisites** Trained in Stealth
-
You often smuggle things past the authorities. When the GM rolls your Stealth check to see if a passive observer notices a small item you've *Concealed*, the GM uses the number rolled or 10—whichever is higher—as the result of your die roll, adding it to your Stealth modifier to determine your Stealth check result. If you're a master in Stealth, the GM uses the number rolled or 15, and if you're legendary in Stealth, you automatically succeed at hiding a small concealed item from passive observers. This provides no benefits when a creature attempts a Perception check while actively searching you for *Hidden* items.

-
**PFS Note** This feat allows you to Earn Income with Underworld Lore with tasks of your level -1 (instead of the normal level -2).

; General, Skill
**Source** Pathfinder Player Core

**Prerequisites** trained in Thievery
-
You can *Steal* or *Palm an Object* that's closely guarded, such as in a pocket, without taking the –5 penalty. You can't steal objects that would be extremely noticeable or time consuming to remove (like worn shoes or armor or actively wielded objects). If you're a master in Thievery, you can attempt to Steal from a creature in combat or otherwise on guard. When doing so, Stealing requires 2 actions instead of 1, and you take a –5 penalty.

**Prerequisites** Pickpocket
