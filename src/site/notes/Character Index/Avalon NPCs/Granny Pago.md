# Granny Pago
![granny_pago.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/granny_pago.Token.webp)

Headmistress of the academy, Granny Pago is an elderly human who, having lost the use of her legs, rolls around in a heavy mechanical wheelchair. Her keen intellect is at-odds with her failing memory, so her conversation tends to meander through a series of tangents. She is called ‘granny’ on account of her kind and benevolent nature. She is also an accomplished witch with an equally venerable fox familiar named Chat, although she doesn’t often use magic around others. Perhaps she forgets that she can.
