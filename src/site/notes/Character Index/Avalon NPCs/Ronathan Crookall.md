A man with a calm, calculating air about him, he is constantly adorned with expensive silk clothing, often in bright white and black, and wears rings and necklaces with large, colorful gems and pendants. He is well-groomed with spikey black-brown hair. He is filled with cunning. He likes to feign weakness letting people think what they will. He is a font of random trivia from the lore and stories he has heard from this father.
