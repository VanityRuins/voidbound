# Parson Grimm
![parson_grimm.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/parson_grimm.Token.webp)

Parson Theltikus Grimm, a human cleric of Pharasma, looks very much the part of a cleric of the god of the dead. Tall and thin, robed in black and carrying a skull-themed lantern, he might be mistaken for Death itself on a moonlit night. He does not walk; he stalks. Although dour and mirthless, and more than a little ominous in appearance, Parson Grimm is in fact a kind soul â€“ at least until he detects the presence of undead. His fearful image is enhanced by the long-handled shovel he tends to carry around, for he is used to being a grave-digger as well as an officiant. He even has a side-gig in carpentry. For the coffins, you see.
