# Father Shackleton
![father_shackleton.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/father_shackleton.Token.webp)

Father Shackletonâ€™s first name is unknown, and never offered. This bearded and weatherbitten human cleric of Gozreh is said to be exceedingly wise in the ways of the wind and the waves. He used to be something of an activist, but these days he takes a more passive and peaceful approach to life. These days, all he wants to do is fish. He has been pressganged into being the head of the local fishing guild, a duty he finds tedious.
