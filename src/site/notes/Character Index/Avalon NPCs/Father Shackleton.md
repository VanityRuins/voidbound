Father Shackletonâ€™s first name is unknown, and never offered. This bearded and weatherbitten human cleric of [Gozreh](https://2e.aonprd.com/Deities.aspx?ID=284) is said to be exceedingly wise in the ways of the wind and the waves. He used to be something of an activist, but these days he takes a more passive and peaceful approach to life. These days, all he wants to do is fish. He has been pressganged into being the head of the local fishing guild, a duty he finds tedious.
