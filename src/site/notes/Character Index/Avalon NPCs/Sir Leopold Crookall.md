# Sir Leopold Crookall
![sir_leopold_crookall.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/sir_leopold_crookall.Token.webp)

This mustachioed human is a huntsman of great enthusiasm. Filled with a zest for life, and especially for the life of the hunter, the mustachioed and monocled Sir Leopold Crookall is scarcely seen without his blunderbuss, pistol, and long rifle. Thus armed to the teeth, this jovial soul marches alone into the wilderness to track and fell the most dangerous of beasts. Sir Crookall claims to know no fear and to live for the thrill of the hunt. He is irrepressible, always rearing to get back into ‘the action.’ He often leaves the munitions shop to his son, Ronathan, who is more subdued. Sir Crookall treats all people as if they were close compatriots, which many find grating. Kassi, at the hunting lodge, considers Sir Crookall an absurd fool. But if Sir Crookall even knows what anyone thinks, he doesn’t particularly care.
