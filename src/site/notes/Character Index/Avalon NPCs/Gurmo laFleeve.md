This halfling looks more like a scruffy groundskeeper than a druid – but why can’t he be both? Quick with a laugh, and quick to share his pipe, Gurmo generally walks around in mud-stained overalls, pushing a wheelbarrow containing a shovel, a rake, a hoe, and other implements of gardening. Many have asked why he uses all those tools when he can accomplish so much more, and that so much easier, with his druidic nature powers. Gurmo replies simply that he likes working with his hands and getting them dirty. Rather than any kind of house, Gurmo prefers his old dusty hammock under the sun and stars. He can often be found reclining there while serenading the birds and insects with his banjo or harmonica.
