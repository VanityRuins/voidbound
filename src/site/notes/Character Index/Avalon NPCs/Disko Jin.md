# Disko Jin

The eccentric and talented elven entertainer known as Disko Jin is a mystery, and an unsettling one. Acrobatics, juggling, the singing of tearful ballads and inspirational marching songs – it seems that no performative act falls beyond his abilities. But there is an edge to his songs when he sings of war and death, and he is perhaps just a bit too comfortable with all those knives he’s juggling. The more one peers beneath the jokes and the bright colors, the more a picture appears which is altogether more dangerous. Disko Jin always seems to know what is going on, is never caught by surprise, and always gives good advice.
