# Prester Benedict
![prester_benedict.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/prester_benedict.Token.webp)

The sociable halfling Prester Benedict is a nearly ideal innkeeper: friendly, professional, tidy, good with money, and so on. If there is one problem, it’s the conspiracy theories. Prester has a lot of strange ideas about how the world works. One week the story is that three of the gods in the pantheon were made up by the rest, the next it’s that agents of the Darklands have replaced some of the top governmental officials on the surface world. And so on.
