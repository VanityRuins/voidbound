# Mr. Mowzassa

It is possible that the boisterous half-orc lumberjack who goes by Mr. Mowzassa does not know what shirts are for. At any rate, he has never yet been seen wearing one. On the contrary, he takes every opportunity to ensure that anyone nearby can view and admire his incredibly well-developed musculature. Mr. Mowzassa has one overriding passion in life: wrestling. He is a master of this art form, and will challenge any and every creature he comes across. He would wrestle a dragon even if he had no chance of winning, and he would wrestle a small child under the assumption that the child was endeavoring to improve both its technique and physique.
