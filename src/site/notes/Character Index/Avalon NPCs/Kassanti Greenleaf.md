Kassanti Greenleaf is a young elf from a distant arctic tribe. Focused and determined, she is surpassingly skilled in hunting with her longbow. Rumors swirl about her impressive feats of long-range archery; this, in combination with her great beauty, makes her quite popular. She has pale skin and snow-white hair tied with green ribbons (her favorite color). She left her large family and her many younger brothers in search of worldly experience, and she approaches life with a single-minded focus upon improving her skills and proving herself to the world.
