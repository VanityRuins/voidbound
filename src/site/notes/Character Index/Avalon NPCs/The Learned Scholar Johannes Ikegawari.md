“The Learned Scholar Johannes Ikegawari” is how this studious elf has been cited in various publications and journals. Johannes is an introverted, bespectacled, and somewhat overweight young elf who can always be found among his books and scrolls, his fingers ink-stained, surrounded with the loose pages of his latest manuscripts. His ambition is to create a sort of simple yet comprehensive summary of the whole world and its notable features – nations, weather patterns, histories, monsters, and so on. It will be called The Incomplete Atlas of the All-World. An ambitious project, but he’s well on his way. Johannes, though easily distracted, possesses fantastic powers of perception and deduction, and has the ability to deduce a staggering amount of information about the party from the merest glance.
