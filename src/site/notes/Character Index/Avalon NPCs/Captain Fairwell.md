# Captain Fairwell
![captain_emaliza_fairwell.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/captain_emaliza_fairwell.Token.webp)

Captain Emaliza Fairwell is the commander of the convoy. She is energetic, assertive, and cheerful. She is always on the move, and her readiness to leap into any kind of work that needs to be done, regardless of her station, has earned her the respect of those under her.  
  
Emaliza is young and idealistic; she rose quickly through the ranks due to her natural talent, but she is unfamiliar with the ways of intrigue and politics. She also enjoys carousing in taverns and mead halls, where she can drink nearly anyone under the table.
