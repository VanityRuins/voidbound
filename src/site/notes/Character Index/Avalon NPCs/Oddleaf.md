The ancient crone named Oddleaf is a dwarf, although this may not be immediately obvious. With her eerie black-and-green eyes, her lank white hair, and her withered grey skin, she might be mistaken for a hag or some other monster. Her foul temper and sour disposition certainly do little to dispel such a notion. Oddleaf will live out of town in a hut with her familiar and companion, a battle-scarred grey boar named Kempy. Oddleaf is a witch, but although she seems made for such a profession, it was not always so. Long ago, she was a valiant paladin who cut down monsters and demons by the score. She doesn’t like to talk much about those days, or what happened after. These days she collects and sells occult trinkets. She seems to be looking for something in particular, but will say neither what, nor why…
