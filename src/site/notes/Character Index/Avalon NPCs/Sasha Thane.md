# Sasha Thane
![sasha_thane.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/sasha_thane.Token.webp)

Sasha Thane, a hairy mountain of a human, is the captain of the City guard as appointed by Captain Fairwell. He is soft-spoken in spite of his great size, slow to anger and quick to lend his extraordinary strength wherever necessary. He has the respect of the guard not only because of his fighting skill, but because of his well-earned reputation for honesty. Sasha Thane always keeps his word.
