Free Teef, a kobold, is a coward. Ashamed of his cowardice, he volunteered to join the city’s defenders by being a lookout, but now spends his days trembling in anxiety over the possibility of imminent attack. His name comes from an old encounter with a troll that left him with only three teeth – and a crippling fear of trolls, which he imagines to be lurking around every corner. Free Teef admires the party for going bravely off into the wilderness in spite of its many dangers.
