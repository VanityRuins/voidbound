# Legitimate Jack
![legitimate_jack.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/legitimate_jack.Token.webp)

Legitimate Jack is a goblin salesman whose magical merchandise ranges from “useless” to “fraudulent” to “actually cursed.” He dresses in a tattered suit with a bright blue bow-tie. This silver-tongued charlatan makes seemingly impossible sales using charm, flattery, and his extraordinary knack for detecting exactly what his customers are looking for, and for saying exactly what they want to hear. Although Legitimate Jack lies through his teeth about most of his “rare and exotic” merchandise, it is just possible that somewhere in his cart, in the midst of all the dubious potions and defective magic rings, there are some objects of true power. It’s not as though Jack can tell the difference.
