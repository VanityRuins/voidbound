# Lozard Krimblewick

Lozard Krimblewick is an eccentric gnome who has decided to stave off the bleaching by throwing himself into an endless series of crazy inventions. These range from flying machines to self-opening doors to automated breakfast-assembling mechanisms. Krimblewick’s inventions almost never work and often leave him swathed in bandages for a week or two, but he is undeterred, skipping from project to project without ever feeling the need to carry one through to success. The brewery business is a side hustle for Krimblewick. Luckily, he makes delicious drinks – succeeding as if by accident at the very thing on which he spends the least brainpower
