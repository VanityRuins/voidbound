Sergeant Xilvias, a dwarf, is a pompous ass who will act haughty and disparaging toward the party from day one. He has delusions of grandeur, considering himself a tactical genius and a commander of unparalleled leadership skills. He also seems to think that the ladies are lining up to make his acquaintance. In truth, he does his job serviceably and is fairly capable, but thatâ€™s all. Not many people enjoy the company of Sergeant Xilvias. He does have the shiniest breastplate of them all, though.
