# Djeni al’Tariq

The turban atop this cheerful gnomish alchemist does little to enhance his verticality, but its true purpose is the storage of alchemical supplies. He will happily tell anyone who asks about his prior career as a poisoner. He claims to have been a good one, and can rattle off a list of impressive and important-sounding names of his past “clients” who became acquainted with his poisons firsthand. That all came to an end in a magical accident decades ago, which scrambled his memory. Djeni’s immediate memory has been reversed, so that he remembers several seconds into the future rather than the past. He can no longer assassinate people, but he has found ways to manage a successful alchemy shop.
