# Fennicus Nü

The ratfolk named Fennicus Nü loves numbers. She loves math. She possesses an uncanny knack for counting things at astonishing speed and solving complex numerical problems as if by pure instinct. Thus, she became an accountant. If a Town Hall is built, Fennicus will move in and assume the duty of bookkeeping, where she will contentedly do the work of five people in a quiet corner of a room full of ledgers. Fennicus is shy, nervous when it comes to socializing, and prone to frequently apologizing for her every action. She is quite content with her life, but she does daydream sometimes about going out dancing or drinking or whatever it is that ‘normal’ ratfolk do in order to ‘have a good time.’
