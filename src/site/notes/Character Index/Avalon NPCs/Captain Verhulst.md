This salty old ex-pirate gnoll may be aging, but his tongue is as sharp as ever, and his patience with fools and layabouts is at an all-time low. He runs the docks with an iron fist, so harsh of manner and so ruthlessly efficient that some speculate he must have been some kind of pirate lord. There are even those who theorize that he might be none other than the feared Captain Greyfang, who terrorized the seas on his ship The Dread Design decades ago before vanishing along with his rumored fortune. Of course, this is preposterous! If he really is a pirate lord, with a pirate lord’s treasure…then what is he doing here?
