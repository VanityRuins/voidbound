# Merisa Frangelico
![merisa_frangelico.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/merisa_frangelico.Token.webp)

The bespectacled young human named Merisa Frangelico is the most ordinary member of a wildly eccentric family of adventurers and explorers. She is here as a newly-certified wizard to test her mettle by striking out into the business on her own. Although she is remarkably gifted in wizardry, she is overly trusting and innocent of the treacherous ways of the world. Furthermore, she is astonishingly clumsy. If an object exists, Merisa will find a way to blunder into it, trip over it, or knock it over. Her instructors at wizarding school learned this the hard way, and gave her strict orders to never again, under any circumstances, attempt to brew potions.
