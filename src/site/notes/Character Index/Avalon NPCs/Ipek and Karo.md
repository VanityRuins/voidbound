Ipek and her brother Karo are a pair of energetic and light-hearted tengu. They have dyed their feathers in bright colors, feeling a greater connection to the riotous parrot of the jungle than the somber raven, and their rambunctious personalities reflect this preference. Scarcely seen apart, Ipek and Karo are so similar in mannerism and speech that they come across as two parts of a single being. They even seem to possess some kind of telepathic link. Ipek and Karo like to talk, to jump around, to dance, to tell jokes and to play pranks. Many find their prolonged company exhausting.
