# Llewellyn
![llewellyn.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/llewellyn.Token.webp)

This unusual elf is a syph whose blood flows with traces of primal air magic. Flowing traceries of pale lines mark her dark skin, and she seems to be perpetually accompanied by a soft breeze. Although not exactly a druid, Llewellyn has a deep appreciation and respect for nature, particularly plants and herbs. Something of a botanist, she has spent many years mastering the arts of medicine and healing using not magic, but the natural remedies of science. Llewellyn is soft-spoken and prefers solitude, although she is ever eager to help the sick and wounded.
