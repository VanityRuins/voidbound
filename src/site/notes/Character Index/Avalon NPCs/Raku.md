# Raku

“Raku” means ‘rat.’ He’s not a ratfolk, though; just a rodent-like human. Raku is not a large man, but he’s a confident one. He seems constantly surrounded by an unaccountable aura of menace. He is a sort of criminal kingpin – smuggling, extortion, blackmail, the works. He’s always happy to do business with new customers, but is almost impossible to catch or pin down for those intent on bringing him to justice. The most unusual thing about Raku is that he fervently and frequently denounces the existence of “luck” or “chance” as a real metaphysical concept. Everything is deterministic, he claims, provided you have sufficient information. Despite this, Raku is impossibly lucky, obviously blessed by some deity or other powerful being. Raku, however, denounces all gods as “even bigger frauds than me.”
