# Dr. Prothereo
![dr._prothereo.Token.webp](/img/user/Voidbound%20token%20images/dr._prothereo.Token.webp)

This elderly tawny-furred catfolk is possessed with the spirit of adventure â€“ nevermind that he is in poor health and requires both a crutch and thick glasses to get about. Though his body is failing, his mind is sharp as ever, and his astounding breadth of knowledge has been a boon to the Pathfinder Society for many years. This time, however, it is Dr. Prothereo who will be fighting monsters and making discoveries! Or so he claims. This would be a laughable ambition, given his current state of health, if not for the enormous suit of mechanized power armor that he is close to perfecting.
